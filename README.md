### Selecting Your Training Day

Using the PDF referenced above, locate your desired training day via Month and Day, where Month is the month specified in the calendar and Day starts in the first column of the first row and continues left-right up-down. 

The PDF above has months of 28 days and 35 days. This is emulated by the training day selectors.

Once the training day is selected, it will show the type of day - Rest, Cardio, or Strength.

### Timers - Cardio Day

Cardio days will show the Training Mode as indicated on the PDF. Each cardio day has multiple intervals/timers associated with a training intensity. 

The first timer card will be pre-selected. Press start/stop to start or stop the timer. At the end of each timer, a sound will play and the next timer card will be selected. Press start to start the next timer.

You can advance to the next timer card by clicking the upcoming timer link below the current timer card. No upcoming timer link will show if the last timer card is currently selected.

A clickable back icon will show below the timer card if there is a previous timer card. Clicking the back icon will show the previous timer card.

### Informational Cards - Cardio Day

Three additonal cards will show on cardio days - the Training Mode card, Workout Zones card, and the RPE card.

The Training Mode card is located above the timer card. It displays the Training Mode associated with the selected training day as indicated on the PDF. Information about the Training Mode, including example exercises, are copied from the PDF.

The Workout Zones card and RPE card are located below the timer card. The information in these cards do not change based on the selected training day.

Each timer - excluding Warm Up, Recovery, and Cool Down timers - have an associated heart rate and expected (RPE) rate of perceived exertion. The Workout Zones card and RPE card provide accessible information about these values.
